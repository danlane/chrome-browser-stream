# Chrome Browser Stream

(This was 100% made by AI, including this README)

This Dockerised setup runs a headless Chromium browser in full-screen kiosk mode, renders any webpage in a virtual display (via Xvfb), and streams it live via RTSP to your home network. Perfect for dashboards, countdowns, signage, or anything else you want fullscreen on VLC, Apple TV, or a smart display.
